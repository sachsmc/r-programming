# Introduction

## Learning objectives

```{r}
#| include: false
cat(params$due_date)
```


- Understand and apply programming principles to handle repetitive tasks
- Understand how to use and make your own functions in R
- Use loops in R
- Apply these principles to perform efficient data manipulation, analysis, and reporting

## Why? 
::: {.r-fit-text}
If your research involves any data, it likely also involves: 

- Data management and manipulation
- Analysis
- Reporting of results

This means lots of __code__. 

We can borrow some ideas from software development to 

1. Make our lives easier -- repetitive tasks, updates with new data
2. Make science better -- reproducible, understandable, reusable
:::


## Goals

At a bare minimum, we want our code to be: 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Organized

- Coherent structure of 
    + folders, files, and scripts

### Transportable

- Works on 
    + my future computer
    + other people's computers
    
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Understandable

- Clearly specified dependencies
- Readable code, sensible naming of things
- Written documentation explaining what and how

:::

::::



## Extras

Nice to have, but not absolutely necessary

### Provably correct

Through automated testing

- Pieces of code correctly do what they should
- Code works together correctly, not sensitive to minor changes in the data
- Valid statistical properties

### Version controlled

- History of development is tracked and documented


## Overview of this course

### Lectures

### Lessons

Work through a problem together, learn tools and strategies

#### Sticky note system

![red note](redsticky.png){width=10%} = "I need help!"

![green note](greensticky.png){width=10%} = "Good to go!"

No sticky = still working

# About me

## What I do

- Develop and evaluate statistical methods
    + Write R packages
    + Write R code to test the methods
- Collaborate on research projects involving data analysis
    + Use register and other data from stats Denmark
    + Data analysis, visualization and reporting


## My R philosophy

- I started learning R in 2005 (version 2.2)
- There is almost no problem that can't be solved with R
    - Flexible and dynamic
    - Plays nicely with almost any other programming language
    
## Course philosophy

- There are no stupid questions
- There are many ways to solve a problem, there is no single "right way"
- I will not force you to learn any particular way, e.g., `tidyverse` vs `data.table`, we will focus on learning the general principles. 
    + Try them out, then choose one and get good at it
    + Same with project organization, choose a system and stick with it
- Show up to class and participate, you will pass and hopefully learn something useful


## Take notes and practice

To get credit for the course, you must attend at least 80% of the course.

I encourage you to work on the exercises and take notes as we proceed. 

1. Use quarto to blend code, output, and prose.
2. Demonstrate mastery of at least 3 out of the 4 learning objectives. 
3. Review the previous day's material and build on it in the next day.



## Office hours and independent study

- This is the condensed version of the course. Lectures and lessons from 8 - 12 each day. Sometimes it will seem fast.  
- You will need to spend some time on your own reviewing the material and practicing

Every day after class (from 12 - 14), I will hold office hours where you can come ask questions and get help on any R topic

My office is CSS 10.2.25

## Interactive slides

Slides will occasionally allow you to interact with the code. Follow along with lectures and use it for short quizzes. Try it out: 

```{webr}
#| autorun: false
mod <- lm(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)
summary(mod)
```
