The aim is to take the intermediate R user to the next level, and make use of programming techniques for more efficient use of R. A key focus in on introducing loops and functions. The course will consist of lectures and exercises over 4 days. This will give the students a chance to use and work with different aspects of R.\n\n\n\nPh.D.-students and health researchers with a basic knowledge of statistics corresponding to the course on basic statistics for health researchers and with a good working knowledge of R, e.g., as obtained by having already followed an introductory course on R.\nParticipants are expected to bring their own laptop with R installed for the exercises.\n\n\n\nThe course is relevant to PhD students from the following graduate programmes at the Graduate School of Health and Medical Sciences, UCPH:\nALL GRADUATE PROGRAMMES\n\n\n\nEnglish.\n\n\n\nLectures in four half days, four optional exercise hours placed as one each week.\n\n\n\nMichael Sachs, Section of Biostatistics\n\n\n\nMichael Sachs and other members of the staff at the Section of Biostatistics.\n\n\n\n1, 4, 8, 11 November 2022, all days from 8.00-12.00.\n\n\n\nCSS"
