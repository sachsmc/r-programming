# COURSE DESCRIPTION

## Course title 

Programming and statistical modelling in R

## Learning objectives

The aim of the course is to make the participants able to 

- use programming principles (loops and functions) to handle repetitive tasks 
- use functions in R 
- use loops in R 
- do efficient data manipulation and aggregation

## Content

The course covers use of the statistical software package R. The aim is to take the intermediate R user to the next level, and make use of programming techniques for more efficient use of R. A key focus in on introducing loops and functions. The course will consist of lectures and exercises over 4 days. This will give the students a chance to use and work with different aspects of R. 

## Participants

Ph.D.-students and health researchers with a basic knowledge of statistics corresponding to the course on basic statistics for health researchers and with a good working knowledge of R, e.g., as obtained by having already followed an introductory course on R. 

_Participants are expected to bring their own laptop with R installed for the exercises._
