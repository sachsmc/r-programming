### Learning objectives {.alert .alert-success}

In this lesson you will 

1. Practice tidying statistical results
2. See and understand how to reshape data from wide to long and long to wide


## Tidying our mean sd function

Load the `broom` package and look at the source code for `tidy.lm`
```{r}
broom:::tidy.lm
```


1. Write a tidy method for our `mean_sd` function and try it out on the penguins dataset. 
2. Apply the `mean_sd` function to the penguins body mass in grams by species and sex. Organize the results into a table suitable for publication, where it is easy to compare the two sexes.


## Tidying the national patient register dataset

Load the LPR data example from `"https://sachsmc.github.io/r-programming/data/lpr-ex.rds"`

```{r}
library(here)
lpr <- readRDS(here("data", "lpr-ex.rds"))
```

Use the tidy principles to do the following: 

1. Reshape the data into wide, where the columns are the primary diagnosis (hdia) at each visit number
2. Reshape the data into longer format, where all of the diagnoses are stored in a single variable, with another variable indicating the primary diagnosis. 
3. Create a new variable for each participant which equals TRUE if they had any diagnosis of either D150, D152, or D159 before the date 1 January 2010.
