### Learning objectives {.alert .alert-success}

In this lesson you will 

1. Manipulate dates and times with `lubridate`
2. Learn some basic regular expressions for matching ICD-10/ATC codes


## Read in the data

From the [data](../data/index.html), download and read in the file "med-2005-ex.rds". 

```{r}
library(here)
med2005 <- readRDS(here("data", "med-2005-ex.rds"))
```

## Dates

1. Use the `lubridate` package (try the function `wday`) to calculate the day of the week when the dispensation occurred. Do dispensations occur less frequently on weekends? 
2. Calculate the month of the dispensation. Is there a seasonal trend on the number of dispensations? 
3. Use `dplyr` or `data.table` to create a new variable that is the last dispensation for each individual during the year (using `group_by` then `mutate` or `:=` with `by`). Then calculate the number of days between each dispensation and the last one. What is the average number of days? 

## Regular expressions


The "atc" variable contains the ATC code for the drug that was dispensed. This is a standardized classification system for drugs, see [https://www.whocc.no/atc/structure_and_principles/](https://www.whocc.no/atc/structure_and_principles/). 

1. Count how many dispensations there were for drugs in the class "J01". Use the `grepl` function with a pattern. 
2. Are there any "invalid" ATC codes in the dataset?
