### Learning objectives {.alert .alert-success}

In this lesson you will 

1. Practice working with `if` and `else` statements for conditional execution
2. Practice working with loops for repeated execution


## Simple loops and conditional statements

1. Use a loop to print every number from 1 to 10
2. Modify the loop to print every _even_ number from 1 to 10 (hint: add an `if` statement)



## Loops for statistical analysis

Load the `palmerpenguins` dataset: 

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins
```


1. Write a loop that calculates and prints out the mean for each numeric variable in the `penguins` dataset

<details>
<summary>Hints</summary>
- How do you determine if a variable is numeric? You can use the `is.numeric` function, which returns TRUE or FALSE
- Inside a loop, sometimes `R` does not print things to the console, so you need to wrap them in the `print` function, e.g., `print(mean(x))` inside the loop. 
</details>

2. Modify your loop in 1 so that it prints out the mean, standard deviation, median, and interquartile range for each numeric variable in `penguins`. 

<details>
<summary>Hints</summary>
- Use a nested loop where one of the iterators is the name of a function. To retrieve a function by name, use the `get` function, e.g., `get("mean")` returns the mean function, which can then saved as an intermediate object and be used like any other function.

3. Write a loop to compute 500 bootstrap replicates of the means of bill length, bill depth, and flipper length. Remember to pre-allocate a data structure to store the 500 times 3 values. Provide an estimate of the correlation of the sample means.

<details>
<summary>Hints</summary>
- To get a bootstrap sample of a vector, use the `sample` function with the argument `replace = TRUE`.
- You can store the replicates in a matrix with 500 rows and 3 columns. Refer to the [data structures lecture](../lectures/data-structures.html) for information about indexing matrices.

## Loops to do data manipulation

You may notice that some of the variables have missing values. We would like to replace the missing values with the "typical" value that is observed. 

1. Write a loop that contains an `if` then `else` statement that goes through the variables in `penguins` and replaces missing values with the mean for numeric double variables, and the most frequent value for characters or factors. 

<details>
<summary>Hints</summary>
- Use this function to calculate the mode in a way that returns the same data type.

```{r}
my_mode <- function(x) {
  
  converter <- get(paste0("as.", class(x)))
  tab <- table(x) |> sort(decreasing = TRUE) 
  names(tab)[1] |> converter()
  
}
```

- Inside the loop you will need to check whether the variable is of type "double". Do this using the `is.double` function, which returns a TRUE or FALSE.
- To assign a new value `m` to only the missing elements of a vector `x`, you can do the following `x[is.na(x)] <- m`. Refer to the [data structures lecture](../lectures/data-structures.html) for information about indexing vectors
