### Learning objectives {.alert .alert-success}

In this lesson you will 

1. Learn how to set up a quarto or rmarkdown document
2. Practice managing code chunks to get output to look the way you want
3. Practice and get help with everything you learned in the course


## Testing out Quarto

1. If you can, download and install Quarto from here: [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
2. In Rstudio, click on "New" and then "Quarto document". Give it a name, and choose an output format (the format that you will view the rendered document in). 
3. Add a title, insert a code chunk, and write some prose. Example: print out the first six rows of the palmerpenguins dataset.
4. Click on "Render" and see what happens
5. Experiment with changing the yaml header options, click on Render again and see what changes. Example, if you are using the html output format, try changing the [theme](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html). 
6. Experiment with changing one of the code chunks in the document, Re-render and see what changes.
